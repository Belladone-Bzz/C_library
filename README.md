# My C_library
### :open_book: Project background

> [!NOTE]
**No artificial intelligence was used in this project.**

The aim of this project was to help me understand how the libc library functions work, how to recreate them myself, and how to use them correctly. I did not recode certain functions considered obsolete, while functions deemed useful but only available in C++ were recoded in C and added to the library. This project allowed me to greatly improve the following skills:
- string manipulation
- dynamic allocation
- linked lists
- automated compilation
- library linking
- library creation
- memory management & pointers
